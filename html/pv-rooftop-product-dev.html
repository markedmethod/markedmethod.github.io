					<h4>Building Integrated and Ballasted Photovoltaic Arrays</h4>

					<br>

					<p>I designed carried out the product qualification test plans for various building integrated photovoltaic products by creating FMEAs, working with internal and external engineers, supply chain, and product management.  This ensured that we had accurate reporting of when a product was ready to bring to market relative to engineering and operations checklists to verify the launch will be successful.</p>

					<p>From an engineering perspective the FMEAs showed that the most important elements were safety and stability of the array, installation capability,performance of the array, and maintenance capability.  For each of these requirements exhaustive research, analysis, testing, and design changes were made.</p>
