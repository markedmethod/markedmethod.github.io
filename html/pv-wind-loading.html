					<h4>ASCE 7-10 & Wind Loads on PV Trackers</h4>

					<br>

					<p>There are three strategies to complying with civil engineering codes to demonstrate safety and longevity of PV arrays (rooftop, ground mount, trackers, etc): </p>

					<ul>
					  <li>Applying Standard Drag & Lift Coefficients Per Geometry</li>
					  <li>Applying Maximum Drag & Lift Wind Coefficients</li>
					  <li>Applying Experimentally Determined Drag & Lift Coefficients from Wind Tunnel Testing</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The resulting loads on the panels are resolved by applying the coefficients and applicable safety factors to statistical data for peak gust wind velocity as a function of geographic location as well as to localized features that affect airflow qualities such as boundary layer thickness and turbulence (building corners, hills, proximity to ocean, etc.)</p>

					<p>This layered approach provides a conservative way of estimating the maximum loads the structure must withstand during a 50-year mean recurrance interval.</p>

					<p>For mechanically coupled systems of panels like what are found on building-integrated photovoltaic systems a clever load-reduction can be demonstrated through wind-tunnel testing that exploits the distributed and transitory nature of the lift and drag forces as they pass over a photovoltaic arrays.  By mechanically connecting the panels in the array immediately adjacent panels help keep a panel under gust load stable.</p>
